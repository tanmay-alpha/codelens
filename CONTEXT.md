# CodeLens — Project Context

## 1. Current Issue

We are at **pre-implementation / repo scaffold phase**.

- The engineering plan ([ENGINEERING_PLAN.md.md](./ENGINEERING_PLAN.md.md)) is committed and is final law.
- The monorepo is empty except for the plan document.
- No real code has been written yet.
- The 30-day implementation order (Section 15 of the plan) begins with Issue #1 (download dataset) and ends with deployment + demo video on Day 30.
- The first working demo target is **Day 9**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ml/review` returns real anti-pattern findings.
- The second working demo target is **Day 15**: open a real PR on a test GitHub repo → CodeLens comment appears within 5 seconds.

The immediate task (this session) is to scaffold the monorepo structure, env example, and gitignore — no real code, no implementations, no business logic.

## 2. Tech Stack (Final Decisions)

| Layer | Technology | Version | Reason |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| API Language | Java | 21 (LTS) | Virtual threads, modern records, Spring Boot 3.x |
| API Framework | Spring Boot | 3.3.x | Industry standard, JPA, Security, OAuth2 all built-in |
| Build Tool | Maven | 3.9 | Simpler for single Spring Boot module |
| ML Language | Python | 3.11 | HuggingFace ecosystem, PyTorch |
| ML Framework | FastAPI | 0.115 | Async, Pydantic v2, auto docs |
| ML Model | microsoft/codebert-base | latest | Code-specific pre-training, 125M params, feasible on CPU |
| Frontend | Next.js | 15 (App Router) | You already know this |
| Frontend UI | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | latest | Fast, consistent |
| Charts | Recharts | 2.x | Works with React, simple API |
| Extension | TypeScript | 5.x | VS Code extension API requires it |
| Database | PostgreSQL | 16 | Relational, mature, free |
| ORM | Spring Data JPA + Hibernate | via Spring Boot | Reduces boilerplate |
| Cache | Redis | 7.x | Webhook dedup only (tiny usage) |
| Auth | GitHub OAuth 2.0 + JWT | — | Users sign in with GitHub, JWT for stateless API |
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose | — | Local dev + deployment |
| API Client (Java) | Spring WebClient | via Spring Boot | Non-blocking HTTP calls to FastAPI |

### What we are NOT using
- Kafka / RabbitMQ (overkill for MVP — use `@Async`)
- GraphQL (REST is sufficient)
- Kubernetes (Railway handles orchestration)
- Elasticsearch (no full-text search needed)
- Redis for session storage (JWT is stateless)

## 3. Service Map (from Section 2 of plan)

| Service | Path | Port | Owns |
|---------|------|------|------|
| API | `apps/api` | 8080 | Business logic, GitHub integration, OAuth, webhooks, DB, orchestration |
| ML Worker | `apps/ml-worker` | 8000 | Diff → anti-pattern findings (CodeBERT inference only) |
| Web | `apps/web` | 3000 | UI — dashboard, PR review, taxonomy, settings |
| VS Code Ext | `apps/vscode-ext` | — | In-editor squiggles + hover via `/api/scan/file` |
| GitHub Action | `github-action/` | — | CI integration via `/api/scan/action` |

## 5. Non-Negotiable Decisions

These are locked. No deviation without an explicit change request and written reason.

1. **Monorepo layout** is exactly what Section 1 of the plan specifies. No reorganizing.
2. **No Kafka / RabbitMQ / GraphQL / Kubernetes / Elasticsearch** for MVP. Use `@Async`, REST, Railway, none.
3. **JWT in httpOnly cookies**, never localStorage (XSS prevention).
4. **API keys**: `cl_live_` prefix + 32 hex chars, bcrypt-hashed in DB, prefix stored plaintext for display.
5. **Webhook security**: HMAC-SHA256, timing-safe comparison via `MessageDigest.isEqual`.
6. **DB encryption**: GitHub OAuth tokens + webhook secrets encrypted with AES-256-GCM via Spring `@Convert`. Single `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var.
7. **ML worker is internal-only**. Never exposed to internet. Validated by `ML_WORKER_SECRET` header.
8. **Threshold = 0.5** sigmoid per label. Do not change without documenting.
9. **Test split is untouched** until final eval (`test.json` is sacred).
10. **Train/val/test split by PR ID**, not random rows (prevents leakage).
11. **Loss function is BCEWithLogitsLoss** for multi-label classification.
12. **Branch strategy**: `main` is protected, no direct commits, every change is a PR.
13. **One commit per logical step** during scaffolding. No batching.
14. **Structure only** until this scaffold session is complete. No real code yet.

## 6. Session Log

| Date | What happened |
|------|---------------|
| 2026-06-21 | Initial scaffold session. Created CONTEXT.md, monorepo structure, .gitignore, .env.example. Repo pushed to `origin/main`. |

## 7. How to Use This File

- New session? Read this file first, then re-read [ENGINEERING_PLAN.md.md](./ENGINEERING_PLAN.md.md) Section relevant to your current issue.
- Starting an issue? Update the checkbox in Section 4.
- Making a non-trivial decision? Add it to Section 5 only after asking the principal engineer.
- Finished a session? Add a row to Section 6 with the date and a one-line summary.
